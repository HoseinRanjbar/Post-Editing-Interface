# Post-Editing-Interface
Incorporating human supervision can significantly enhance the accuracy of results. This interface is designed to facilitate post-editing of sign language data generated by an automated system.

The interface is divided into two main components: **Frame-Level Editing** and **Segment-Level Editing**.

### Frame-Level Editing:
In this section, users can manually edit pose data. Future updates will introduce additional features, allowing users to adjust the position, orientation, and posture of the signer within the video.

In the video below, you can see some features of the **Frame-Level Editing** component of the interface. The user corrects keypoints that were mistakenly placed by the automatic pose estimator.

### Segment-Level Editing:
This section allows users to modify the original file—whether it's a pose or video—at the segment level. Users can insert new video or pose data into the original file and remove sections as needed. 

**Video synthesis capabilities have been integrated into the interface.**

If you need to modify a segment of a video, simply record a new video of yourself or insert an existing one. The system will extract the pose sequence from the video, and the Musepose model will generate a new video based on the reference image (signer's appearance) and the extracted pose sequence.
